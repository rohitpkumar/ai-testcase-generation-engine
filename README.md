📌 AI Test Case Generation
🚀 AI-Powered QA Automation Framework

This project is an AI-driven QA framework that automatically:

Extracts structured requirements from a PRD

Generates functional, negative, and edge test cases

Analyzes test coverage

Detects coverage gaps

Exports production-ready CSV reports

🧠 Problem It Solves

AI startups struggle with:

Manual test case writing from PRDs

Missing edge case coverage

Inconsistent QA documentation

Lack of traceability and governance

This framework automates the QA analysis pipeline using LLMs.

🎯 Now — Why This README Is Powerful

When a startup founder reads this, they see:

You understand AI governance

You handle non-deterministic output

You build structured evaluation systems

You think beyond “just calling GPT”

🚀 Step 9 — Add One More Powerful Section (Optional but Strong)

Add this at bottom of README:

🔮 Future Enhancements

Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

AI-to-AI validation (Meta QA layer)

Risk scoring model

Prompt regression testing

FastAPI backend

Streamlit UI

CI/CD integration

This shows strategic thinking.

🎯 How To Position This In Resume

Under Projects:

AI Test Case Generation Engine (LLM-powered QA Framework)

Designed an AI-driven QA automation pipeline to extract structured requirements from PRDs

Automated generation of functional, negative, and edge test cases

Implemented coverage analysis and gap detection system

Built deterministic JSON parsing and LLM output validation

Generated exportable QA governance reports (CSV)

🔥 Now Important Question

Do you want to:

Add Requirement Traceability Matrix (very strong)

Add AI validation layer (AI reviewing AI output)

Convert to simple Streamlit UI (startup friendly)

Start next project (LLM Evaluation Framework)

Tell me which direction you want.

You are now building like an AI QA Architect.
